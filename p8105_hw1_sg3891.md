## Question 1

The following code produces a data frame comprised of: a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
df_problem1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Sandya", "Ganesh", "and", "I", "love",
               "data", "science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "low",
                        "low", "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```

#### Take the mean of each variable in df\_problem 1

Taking the mean of the numerical random sample vector (vec\_numeric) and
logical vector (vec\_logical) worked. However, taking the mean of the
character vector (vec\_char) and factor vector (vec\_fac) did not work,
and I received a warning message stating that the argument is not
numeric or logical.

#### Convert the variables in df\_problem 1 to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_factor))
```

We are able to convert the logical vector to a numeric vector with 0’s
and 1’s. We are also able to convert the factor vector to a numeric
vector with 1, 2, 3. However, we are not able to convert the character
vector to a numeric vector. This is because there are no commonalities
found in the character type, and it explains why we cannot get a mean
for the character vector. However, a mean was not produced for the
factor vector even though it was successfully converted to a numeric
vector, and this may have been because a mean value would not have been
meaningful.
