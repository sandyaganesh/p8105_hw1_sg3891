## Question 1

The following code produces a data frame comprised of: a random sample
of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
df_problem1 = tibble(
  rand_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = rand_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Sandya", "Ganesh", "and", "I", "love",
               "data", "science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "low",
                        "low", "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```
