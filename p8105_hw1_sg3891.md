Load the tidyverse library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Question 1

The following code chunk produces a data frame comprised of: a random
sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”.

``` r
df_problem1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Sandya", "Ganesh", "and", "I", "love",
               "data", "science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "low",
                        "low", "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```

#### Take the mean of each variable in df\_problem1

``` r
mean(pull(df_problem1, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.2573337

``` r
mean(pull(df_problem1, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(df_problem1, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_problem1, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_problem1, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_problem1, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of the numerical random sample vector (vec\_numeric) and
logical vector (vec\_logical) worked. However, taking the mean of the
character vector (vec\_char) and factor vector (vec\_fac) did not work,
and I received a warning message stating that the argument is not
numeric or logical.

#### Convert the variables in df\_problem 1 to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(df_problem1, vec_factor))
```

We are able to convert the logical vector to a numeric vector with 0’s
and 1’s, which explains why we can get a mean for the logical vector.
This happens because the logical vector is outputting TRUE or FALSE,
which is easily converted to 0’s and 1’s.

We are also able to convert the factor vector to a numeric vector with
1, 2, and 3, because the software recognizes there are 3 levels to the
factor vector and assigns each level a number. However, this does not
explain why a mean was not produced for the factor vector. This may be
because a mean value would not have been a meaningful statistic to
describe the 3 levels.

Finally, we are not able to convert the character vector to a numeric
vector, and it returns an NA value because there is no underlying
numeric integer representation for the character vector. This explains
why we cannot get a mean for the character vector, because it is not
possible to convert the character string into a numeric needed to
calculate the mean.

## Question 2

The following code loads the penguins dataset and includes a description
of the penguins dataset, as well as a scatterplot of the data.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the Penguins Dataset

Below we describe the dataset including names / values of important
variables, the size of the dataset, and the mean flipper length.

The names of the variables in the penguins data set include species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year. Of these variables, some important variables
to to understand the characteristics of the penguins include the various
species, sex, bill\_length\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm. There are 3 species
of penguins that include Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. There are 165 female
and 168 male penguins in the data. The range of values for the penguin
bill length is (32.1, 59.6 mm).

The size of the data set penguins is 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm.

#### Scatterplot of the Penguins Dataset

Below is a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and flipper length
on the y-axis. The 3 species of penguins can be seen in the legend and
are colored in the plot. The code chunk here creates the scatter plot
and saves the image.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)
       ) + geom_point()
```
